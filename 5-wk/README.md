soloLearn C++ Functions

declare functions, pass arguments and the normal function stuff in any programming language

In the C++ standard library, you can access a pseudo random number generator function that's called rand(). When used, we are required to include the header <cstdlib>.

```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <cstdlib>
    int main() {
        std::cout << rand()
    }
```

The srand() function is used to generate truly random numbers.
This function allows to specify a seed value as its parameter, which is used for the rand() function's algorithm

use `srand(int seed_value)` to generate truly random numbers

`time()` get number of seconds on your system time
have to include ctime for this

```cpp
    #include <ctime>
```
