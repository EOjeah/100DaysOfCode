soloLearn C++ Functions

declare functions, pass arguments and the normal function stuff in any programming language

In the C++ standard library, you can access a pseudo random number generator function that's called rand(). When used, we are required to include the header <cstdlib>.

```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <cstdlib>
    int main() {
        std::cout << rand()
    }
```

The srand() function is used to generate truly random numbers.
This function allows to specify a seed value as its parameter, which is used for the rand() function's algorithm

use `srand(int seed_value)` to generate truly random numbers

`time()` get number of seconds on your system time
have to include ctime for this

```cpp
    #include <ctime>
```

upto lesson 41.1

More C++ on sololearn
Learned about passing references or values to functions
passing in the reference to a varible can change the value unlike just passing in the value which creates a local copy and doesn't change the original variable

some Elasticsearch with the brother, not planned on the 100 days journey but helped answer some general elasticsearch questions and and leanred how his company uses typescript and elasticsearch sdk
Typescript looks like a completely different language than english, started learning a while ago but no where to apply it so gave up because i'd forget anyway. Might try to build a typescript project i'll use at work but down side is my team mainly use python...
