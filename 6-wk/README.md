Binary Search Tree
Implement your BST with two methods, `insert` and `lookup`
make the lookup function return the node you're looking for and if it doesn't find the node, return `null`

> I always forget this and not sure how I remembered it this time, but you can debug your javscript code using node by running the code with $node --inspect-brk index.js and visiting the page chrome://inspect on Chrome obviously, to start a debug session.

Helped me debug a bug in my code which worked fine on paper but I put the return statement in my `while` block instead of outside.

`node --inspect-brk index.js`

Basically the same solution as the instructor but with different variable names
